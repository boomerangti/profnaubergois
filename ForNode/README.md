# Welcome To My Node.JS Course!
This repository holds various materials, demos and instructions for my Node.JS course


## Preparation
As we meet in the classroom we wish to spend our precious time on interesting development challenges rather than machine setup. Make sure to prepare your machine aforehand. Should you encounter any issue - please open an issue within this repo and I'll be sure to assist shortly

### ✔ 1 Install Node.JS LTS
Install Node.JS LTS (any 12.0.X version) [from this website](https://nodejs.org/en/) - just download and progress within the installation wizard


### ✔ 2 Ensure Node is installed correctly
Open your favourite terminal (Windows: command prompt) and type 'NPM verson'. The output should confirm that version (e.g. 12.0) is indeed installed

### ✔ 3 Clone this repo
Run the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodejs-course/
```

Then navigate into the project directory and install all depedencies:
```
npm install
```


### ✔ 4 Install IDE (editor)
I highly recommend using VSCode editor in the course as it's lightweight and has a very rich plugins eco-sysem that we might use during our excercise. Simply visit the [downloads site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and choose the edition that suits your operations system. You may opt for any other editor that supports Node debugging and intellisense


### ✔ 5 Install POSTMAN
Some of our excercises require to perform web requests, POSTMAN is a popular client tool for running HTTP requests. [Download page](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)

### ✔ 6 Polish Your JS Skills
Learning Node requires to be familiar with Javascript. Beside mastering the basic principals of JS, it's recommended to get acquaintance with the following concepts that are highly related to Node.JS:
